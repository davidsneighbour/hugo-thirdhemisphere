This is a work-in-progress to create an SEO-optimised HUGO theme. Principles:
- Optimised technical SEO, including [[https://schema.org/][schema.org]] for website and articles
- Mimicking the functionality of the [[https://yoast.com/][Yoast SEO Wordpress]] plugin
- Based on [[https://bulma.io/][Bulma CSS]], based on the work by [[https://www.pakstech.com/blog/create-hugo-theme/][PÃ¤ktech]]

This theme is in development and is not available in the wild just yet.
